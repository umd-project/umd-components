# umd-components

> Module that provides access to all the components supported in the UMD Document.

## Usage

This is an ES6 module and can be imported as below:

```
import {UmdComponentAudio, UmdComponentForm, UmdComponentImage, UmdComponentMd, UmdComponentPdf, UmdComponentText, UmdComponentVideo} from "./umd-components.min.js";
```

Most developers would not have the need to access this module. It is used internally by the `umd-viewer` component that is the webcomponent interface to integrate the umd-viewer in any web app or web site.
